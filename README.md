# JSQR

This repository contains a software implementation of the joint spatial quantile regression model in R based on the paper: Chen X and Tokdar ST, Joint Quantile Regression for Spatial Data (submitted). All the functions in this repository will be later incorporated in the R package qrjoint (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qrjoint/index.html).

A vignette is provided to illustrate how to perform model fitting, model comparison and prediction.

The simulation results in the paper can be reproduced using the files in the simulation folder. Each folder contains a readme document providing details on the files in the folder.
