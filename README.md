This repository contains a software implementation of the joint spatial quantile regression model in R based on the paper: Chen X and Tokdar ST, Joint Quantile Regression for Spatial Data (submitted). 

A vignette is provided to illustrate how to perform model fitting, model comparison and prediction.

The simulation results in the paper can be replicated using the files in the simulation folder. Each folder contains a readme document providing details on each file in the folder.
